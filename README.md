# KML to HTML Table Converter

This project aims to simplify the process of converting KML files containing Google Earth placemarks into HTML tables. It eliminates the need for manual extraction and copying of pole coordinates from Google Earth. By uploading a KML file, the app generates an HTML table displaying the pole names and their corresponding coordinates. This tool is especially useful for professionals who frequently use Google Earth and need to include multiple placemark coordinates in their reports.
